I entered the recruitment industry in mid 2024 and _instantly_ noticed so many problems‚Ä¶

Nobody knew what the hell they are doing and hiring someone effectively was a _complete mess_.

And obviously, where humans are involved, there are bound to be complications and inefficiencies.

But I still thought that there has to be a better way to do this.

These are the options that recruiters have at the moment...

## Indeed
Platforms like Indeed have two ways they offer their services...

### Database Solutions
Not going to lie, hiring from databases is the **best option** for entry level positions like Receptionists, Web Designers, Telecallers, etc.

These leads are extremely cheap, there are lot‚Äôs of options, and it doesn‚Äôt take more than a week to close a vacancy if you‚Äôre sourcing candidates from this method.

This probably won‚Äôt work for even slightly more niche and burning positions within the company since they are just fewer such people in the market, and most of them aren‚Äôt lurking around on job websites.

Try searching for a ‚ÄúBlockchain Developer‚Äù or ‚ÄúCloud Solutions Architect‚Äù in one of these databases‚Ä¶

You‚Äôre honestly just lucky if you manage to hire high demand, low supply positions from here.

### Job Post Solutions

This option is also great if you want to just lay back and casually get candidate submissions thought the day...

**BUT,**

Have you ever made a job post and just get like **400 applications?**

And the pain that you have to go through in order to _see each resume_ and realising that most of them don‚Äôt even fit the job description?!

I had one entrepreneur from the hospitality industry tell me that they had **500 applications** for a certain position that they were hiring for and they had to reject all of them.

Although I have to agree, just like the database method, job posts do work fairly well for entry level positions.

So the problem remains...

_**How do we effectively hire the people that we want to hire but have no effective way to find them?**_

## Recruitment Agency/Consultant

I believe that the best recruitment agencies in the world are doing an **incredible job** offering a wide range of candidates super fast.

However, we have all experienced what 95% of the agencies are doing...

They can barely give you candidates, and when they finally do after 2 months, take a quick 8-15% commission which just doesn‚Äôt feel right to be giving them, even though they deserve it.

And the reality is that most such firms are themselves relying on Databases & Job Posts üôÇ

## Active Vs. Passive Candidates

One thing that is common across all the 3 methods we spoke about is that they target candidates _actively seeking jobs._

This leaves out a majority of candidates that you can target since only **30% of the job market is actively looking for a job** at any given point in time.

The rest of the market is the following ‚Äî they aren‚Äôt looking for a job unless they are offered one.

And they will take that job if it makes sense for them.

That‚Äôs where Recruv√§ comes in.

## Recruv√§

Let‚Äôs combine the strengths of the database & job post method with this one...

You can access to the **Entire Professional Network of LinkedIn** AND get responses from _only relevant candidates_ passively.

I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm the first person to come up with this idea and how it‚Äôs not mainstream already...

All you have to do is search for the relevant keywords of the candidate that you are hiring inside LinkedIn Search, Import those leads into Recruv√§, Create an Automation in 12 minutes, and start getting candidate responses by the next day.

Feature & Effectiveness, Recruv√§ is a no brainer...

But What About

## Pricing?

I‚Äôll break it down for you without any bullshit.

The Recruv√§ Pro Plan costs **‚Çπ51000 INR or $578 USD** per month, and you can *&Hire 15-30 People a Month** if you use it to its full potential.

That boils down to just **‚Çπ2700 - ‚Çπ5400 or $49 - $98 PER HIRE** if you consider that you‚Äôre using 30 Sender Profiles and have bought LinkedIn Premium for all the accounts (which we recommend).

Even if you only hire 3 people in a month that you‚Äôve been struggling since many months, that‚Äôs still **‚Çπ17999 INR or $222 USD PER HIRE**.

We know that the costs of a recruitment firm would blow these numbers out of the water.

Considering they‚Äôll charge 8-15% of their yearly fixed CTC, the $ amount would be significantly higher for more difficult positions that have a higher salary.

Platforms like Indeed are the clear winners when it comes to entry level positions and they offer solutions that are simple and familiar, but their effectiveness varies upon the job role that you‚Äôre hiring for.

It‚Äôs always uncomfortable to start using a new product or service and we understand that‚Ä¶

We‚Äôre currently offering a 7 Day Free Trial (without your credit card), NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

Try it out, if you aren‚Äôt satisfied, go back to they methods you love using the most.
